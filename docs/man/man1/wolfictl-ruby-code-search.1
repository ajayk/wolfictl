.SH NAME
.PP
wolfictl\-ruby\-code\-search \- Run Github search queries for ruby packages.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBwolfictl ruby code\-search [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
NOTE: Due to limitations of GitHub Code Search, the search terms are only matched
      against the default branch rather than the tag from which the package is
      built. Hopefully this gets better in the future but it could lead to false
      negatives if upgrade work has been committed to the main branch but a release
      has not been cut yet.
