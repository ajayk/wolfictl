.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBwolfictl advisory list\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
List advisories for specific packages, vulnerabilities, or the entire data set.

.PP
The 'list' (or 'ls') command prints a table of advisories based on the given
selection criteria. By default, all advisories in the current advisory data set
will be listed.

.PP
FILTERING

.PP
You can list advisories for a single package:

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls \-p glibc

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can list all advisories for a given vulnerability ID across all packages:

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls \-V CVE\-2023\-38545

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can filter advisories by the type of the latest event:

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls \-t detection

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can filter advisories by the detected component type:

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls \-c python

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can filter advisories by the date they were created or last updated:

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls \-\-created\-since 2024\-01\-01
wolfictl adv ls \-\-created\-before 2023\-12\-31
wolfictl adv ls \-\-updated\-since 2024\-06\-01
wolfictl adv ls \-\-updated\-before 2024\-06\-01

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can show only advisories that are considered not to be "resolved":

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls \-\-unresolved

.fi
.RE

.PP
And you can combine the above flags as needed.

.PP
HISTORY

.PP
Using the \-\-history flag, you can list advisory events instead of just
advisories' latest states. This is useful for viewing a summary of an
investigation over time for a given package/vulnerability match.'

.PP
OUTPUT FORMAT

.PP
Using the \-\-output (\-o) flag, you can select the output format used to render
the results. By default, results are rendered as a "table"; however, you can
also select "json".

.PP
COUNT

.PP
You get a count of the advisories that match the criteria by using the \-\-count
flag. This will report just the count, not the full list of advisories.

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl adv ls <various filter flags> \-\-count

.fi
.RE
