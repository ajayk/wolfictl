.SH NAME
.PP
wolfictl\-ruby \- Work with ruby packages


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBwolfictl ruby [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Work with ruby packages

.PP
The ruby subcommand is intended to work with all ruby packages inside the wolfi
repo. The main uses right now are to check if the ruby version can be upgraded,
and run Github code searches for Github repos pulled from melange yaml files.

.PP
This command takes a path to the wolfi\-dev/os repository as an argument. The
path can either be the directory itself to discover all files using ruby\-* or
a specific melange yaml to work with.

.PP
NOTE: This is currently restricted to ruby code housed on Github as that is the
      majority. There are some on Gitlab and adding Gitlab API support is TODO.

    help for ruby


.SH OPTIONS INHERITED FROM PARENT COMMANDS
